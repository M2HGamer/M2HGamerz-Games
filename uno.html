<title>Uno - Unblocked Games 66</title>
<meta content="Uno is a popular card game that was created in 1971 by Merle Robbins. The game is now owned by Mattel and has become a classic family game that is played all over the world.

In Uno, the game is played with a deck of 108 cards that are divided into four colors - red, green, blue, and yellow. Each color has cards numbered from 0 to 9, as well as special action cards like Skip, Reverse, and Draw Two. There are also four Wild cards and four Wild Draw Four cards.

The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards by matching the color or number of the card in the center of the table. Players take turns playing cards, and if they cannot play a card, they must draw a card from the deck. The game gets more challenging as players add more cards to their hand, and the special action cards can be used to penalize opponents or gain an advantage.

Uno has gained popularity due to its simple, yet challenging gameplay mechanics and its ability to be enjoyed by players of all ages. The game has been praised for its ability to promote social interaction and its replayability. It has also inspired many spin-off versions, including Uno Attack, Uno Spin, and Uno Flip." name="description">
